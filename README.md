These are projects that are no longer maintained, for whatever reason.

---

Each project has a badge and an explanation as to why the project is no longer maintained.

The badge will be one of the following:

- ![project status - replaced](https://img.shields.io/badge/project%20status-replaced-a260e5.svg?style=flat-square) 
- Project has been replaced with a newer project, which replaces or aims to replace the archived project.
