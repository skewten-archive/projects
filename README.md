Each project has a badge and an explanation as to why the project is no longer
maintained:

The badge will be one of the following:

| Badge | Description | Ownership transfer? |
| ----- | ----------- | ------------------- |
| ![project status - replaced](https://img.shields.io/badge/project%20status-replaced-a260e5.svg?style=flat-square) | Project has been replaced with a newer project, which replaces or aims to replace the archived project. | No. Use the new project instead. |
